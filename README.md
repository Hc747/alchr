# Alchr
Alchr is an open source library that allows developers to easily get data from the Oldschool Runescape Grand Exchange and perform functions to determine what is the best item to alch. The development has a focus on clean, well-documented code. It also will have an API for developers to start using it with ease.

### How does Alchr accomplish this?
Alchr depends heavily on JSON. This allows users to easily add an "item" object; it's lightweight, and easily parsed.

### What is it capable of?
Finding an item you would like to alch can be as simple as clicking a button (this is just a library but it gives you the methods to be able to easily build a GUI to do so). Alchr will have the ability to sort though all kinds of data and determine what are the best items to alch. Less money spent is the more desirable item. Indeed, there are already websites out there that can do this; however there are few (if any) Java libraries that can help developers create their own, unique, and (potentially) better version of these websites.
